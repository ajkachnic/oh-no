# oh-no

Let's run through some potential issues

## Broken disk or failure to mount

Just run this code

```sh
fsck /dev/whatever-disk-name
```

## Wrong directory chowned or chmoded

Just run the command that'll reverse the effect (just don't be stupid and chown `/`)

## Removed bootloader

idiot. that's all i have for that one...

look through your backups and remeber the good old days... you could also copy your home directory to an external drive and safe that
